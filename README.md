Hey, I'm Faruk Čaluk!
🎓 I'm a software engineering student with a passion for learning and a drive to stay on top of the fast-paced world of tech.

🥋 When I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me on the mats training in Taekwondo, Kickboxing, or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. These disciplines push me both physically and mentally — teaching focus, discipline, and resilience.

💻 I enjoy working with a range of technologies — from C++ to React — and love building things that are both useful and meaningful. Whether it's a group project or something I'm exploring solo, I’m always looking for ways to grow and improve.

🚀 I regularly collaborate with friends on various tech projects, but I also value those late-night coding sessions where ideas turn into real solutions. You can check out some of what I’ve been working on over on GitHub.
