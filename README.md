🌟 **About Me**

Hi there! I'm a passionate software engineering student who loves to stay on the cutting edge of tech. Whether it's **C++**, **C#**, **JavaScript**, **React**, **Next.js**, **Nest.js**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Tailwind**, or **Bootstrap** — I’m always excited to learn and build new things.

🥋 **Martial Artist by Day, Coder by Night**

When I’m not deep in code, you’ll probably catch me training Taekwondo, Kickboxing, or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Martial arts have taught me focus, discipline, and resilience — qualities I bring to every line of code and project.

💡 **What I Do**

- 💻 Build meaningful, useful software with modern tech
- 🤝 Collaborate on group projects and hackathons
- 🛠️ Tinker solo on late-night coding sessions (where the best ideas are born!)
- 🌱 Always learning — always leveling up
